## A. Online Boutique (previously hipster shop)

### Industry: E-commerce
### Learning objectives:
- How to deploy your application on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- what is gRPC and How to use gRPC? Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to communicate to each other.
- How to get your application to work with istio service mesh.
- What is distributed tracing? Most services in this application are instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP so you can learn about tracing as well. 
- How to use APM?
- How to deploy application to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- You will also learn about Synthetic Load Generation as the application demo comes with a background job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using Locust load generator.

### Introduction

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. Online boutique uses different microservices written in Go, c#, Python, Java and functions as an e-commerce website app, where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them. 

This demo has various ecommerce microservices like order page, cart, payment, shipping, recommendation though it doesn't operate under the scale as real world ecommerce platform which can have so many reasons to fail but this makes really good close to real-world case for our testing.

If you are interested in complex microservices architectures you should look at structure of microservices at Amazon which look like below!

`Note:` We have created this project by modifying some configs in [this](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) demo app by Google Cloud Platform. 

### Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

### Service Description Table

| Service                                              | Language      | Description                                                                                                                       |

| [frontend](./src/frontend)                           | Go            | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Does not require signup/login and generates session IDs for all users automatically. |
| [cartservice](./src/cartservice)                     | C#            | Stores the items in the user's shopping cart in Redis and retrieves it.                                                           |
| [productcatalogservice](./src/productcatalogservice) | Go            | Provides the list of products from a JSON file and ability to search products and get individual products.                        |
| [currencyservice](./src/currencyservice)             | Node.js       | Converts one money amount to another currency. Uses real values fetched from European Central Bank. It's the highest QPS service. |
| [paymentservice](./src/paymentservice)               | Node.js       | Charges the given credit card info (mock) with the given amount and returns a transaction ID.                                     |
| [shippingservice](./src/shippingservice)             | Go            | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (mock)                                 |
| [emailservice](./src/emailservice)                   | Python        | Sends users an order confirmation email (mock).                                                                                   |

| [loadgenerator](./src/loadgenerator)                 | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating realistic user shopping flows to the frontend.                                              |

### Get it running:
Instruction to run app locally using pre-built container images: 

This option offers you pre-built public container images that are easy to deploy
by deploying the [release manifest](./release) directly to an existing cluster.

**Prerequisite**: a running Kubernetes cluster (either local or on cloud).

1. Clone this repository, and go to the repository directory
2. Run `kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml` to deploy the app.
3. Run `kubectl get pods` to see pods are in a Ready state.
4. Find the `NodePort` of your application, then visit the application at `localhost:nodeport` on your
   browser to confirm installation. 

   ```sh
   kubectl get service/frontend-external
   ```
